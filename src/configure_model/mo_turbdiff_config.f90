! @brief: Configuration setup for turbulent processes (turbdiff)
!
! Configuration setup for the entire turblence parameterization (by M. Raschendorfer)
!  based on the modules 'turb_[diffusion|transfer|vertdiff|utilities]:
!
! This module 'mo_turbdiff_config' paricularly includes the whole content of the now obsolete module 'turb_data',
!  that is the declaration and initialization of all required parameters, switches and selectors.
!
! The module also contains a mapping of at least all included variable quantities that define the configuration-state
!  of the scheme to associated components of the domain-specific config-state vector 'turbdiff_config(jg)'.
! Some of these quantities are included into the namelist setting in module 'mo_turbdiff_nml'.
