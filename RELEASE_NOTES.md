# Release notes for icon-2.6.5

It is time for yet another ICON release.

After 10 month we managed to provide a new ICON release with new
machine configurations, a new buildbot, significantly extended,
improved GPU capabilities, first steps into ICON seamless and a
cleaned up version of the MPIM AES physics (now available as aes
physics and not echam anymore.

- CSCS: Introduction of more and optimized OpenACC code parts and
        introducing work to allow later more modularization for
        improving and consolidating of the ICON code.

- DKRZ: Bugfixes and more bugfixes, cdi-1.8.4 incorporates nom (joint
        effort of DKRZ and CIMD) cdi-pio, new versions of all tools
        maintained by DKRZ, a new buildbot (Ralf Müller) and strong
        support for getting ICON running on levante.

- DWD: Introduction of many improvements in the parameterizations, in
       tuning and adding bugfixes. Setting up on the new ECMWF system
       and supporting the data assimilation system. First steps for
       ICON-seamless are done, especially the coupling to ICON ocean
       is technically available and most of the time varying external
       data for climate simulations have been added. However, the code
       variant has to be tuned and extensively tested and some parts are
       still missing. This activity is a joint effort of DWD and MPIM
       colleagues.

- MCH: Is actively providing more, and more model components of the
       NWP physics for the use on GPUs. Furthermore they are
       supporting all activities related to GPUs and testing of large
       parts of the ICON code.

- MPIM AES: To simplify and streamline further high resolution
       modelling only, the echam physics has been renamed as aes
       physics and some former components have been removed as are the
       SSO gravity drag parameterization, as well the gravity drag
       parameterization for the middle atmosphere, and most prominent
       the convection parameterization. As cloud paramterizations the
       DWD graupel and two-moment scheme are available. A few more,
       minor, changes have been applied. Newly added is the former
       large eddy model component the Smagorinsky 'vertical' diffusion
       scheme.

- MPIM OES: Added a new C-grid seaice model (C. Mehlmann) and extensive
       improvements of OpenMP for hamocc.

- MPIM LES: JSBACH got more model components and has been adapted for
       to all changes above its top-level.  - KIT: The aerosoly
       microphysics and plume components have been added as well as a
       large number of bugfixes.

- MPIM CIMD: just a lot of things in the area of coupling, configuring
       and building and model infrastrucuture, new machine setups
       for lumi (CSC), juwels/booster (JSC) and levante (DKRZ)

- All developers: many of the work has been done in cross
  institutional working groups.


A special thanks is going to Sergey Kosukhin (MPIM-CIMD) for his work
on the configuration and build system of ICON making life of
developers much easier.

The work on the GPU code version, implemented based on OpenACC has
been supported by NVIDIA. Thanks a lot, Dmitry Alexeev (and his
colleagues).

  The most important new features are:
    Time handling in JSBACH now supports nested domains (with ECHAM physics), plus fix for the time albedo is calculated for radiation
    New formulation for computation of roughness length (ported from JSBACH3) Implementation of anthropogenic land cover change
    Diagnostic 1d global mean JSBACH output for monitoring

  directories with names made up of both - atmosphere and ocean - grid
  IDs.

- With the current physics coupling only one set of pressure variables
  is needed. Pressure variables in mo_echam_phy_memory are therefore
  replaced. Use add_ref instead of add_var for several more fields.
  Reintroduce an optimised reading of Kinne aerosols, only those month
  are read in which are need for the current job rather than reading
  always the full year.

- introduce standard emissivity to all test cases
