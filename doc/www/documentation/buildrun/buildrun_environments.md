(ref_buildrun_container)=
## Docker Containers

The easiest way to build and run ICON on your personal machine is to use Docker images from the [`iconmodel` repository on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/iconmodel).

We recommend building and running ICON inside the container while managing and editing the source code separately in another terminal, utilizing the tools available on your machine. This scenario implies that the directory with ICON source code is located on the host machine and mounted to the container. You will also need to mount a so-called `pool` directory containing ICON input files, e.g. grid files. The contents and the layout of the directory depend on the experiment you want to run and are not covered in this document.

Run the container in interactive mode as follows:

```sh
docker run -it -v /path/to/icon-src:/home/icon/icon -v /path/to/pool:/home/icon/pool iconmodel/icon-dev
```

where `/path/to/icon-src` and `/path/to/pool` are paths to ICON source and `pool` directories on your machine, and `/home/icon/icon` and `/home/icon/pool` are respective mount points of the directories inside the container.

As a result of the previous command, you will get an interactive command prompt of the container. You can now configure, build and run ICON using the following commands as a reference:

```sh
cd ./icon
./config/generic/gcc
make -j4
./make_runscripts atm_tracer_Hadley
cd ./run
./exp.atm_tracer_Hadley.run
```

To be able to run ICON inside the container, you might need to increase the amount of RAM available to Docker (Preferences->Resources->Memory).

## Further tested platforms and tools

This section provides basic instructions on how to install most commonly required subset of ICON dependencies on different operating systems using relevant package managers.

### macOS with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org)

**Tested on `macOS Sequoia 15.3`.**

:::{admonition} Different package manager on your macOS
:class: admonition-icontheme
If you prefer and use a different package manager on your macOS but want or have to use MacPorts for ICON, you can avoid mixing tools installed by MacPorts with the ones from another package manager by removing the `PATH` modifications that MacPorts automatically introduces into `~/.zprofile`, i.e. you can remove the line `export PATH="/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH"`. The generic configuration wrapper does not need it.
:::

Most of the required software packages are either already available on the system or installed together with the [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/), which are a [prerequisite for MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php). The rest of the required software can be installed by running the following commands:

```sh
# Install building tools and ICON dependencies:
sudo port -N install       \
  cmake                    \
  gcc14                    \
  mpich-gcc14              \
  hdf5 +hl+threadsafe+szip \
  netcdf                   \
  netcdf-fortran +gcc14    \
  eccodes                  \
  libxml2

# Install libfyaml, which is currently not available via MacPorts:
curl -OL https://github.com/pantoniou/libfyaml/releases/download/v0.8/libfyaml-0.8.tar.gz
tar xvf libfyaml-0.8.tar.gz
cd libfyaml-0.8
./configure --prefix=/opt/local
make -j
sudo make install

# The command above can be reverted as follows:
# curl -OL https://github.com/pantoniou/libfyaml/releases/download/v0.8/libfyaml-0.8.tar.gz
# tar xvf libfyaml-0.8.tar.gz
# cd libfyaml-0.8
# ./configure --prefix=/opt/local
# sudo make uninstall

# Select the compiler and MPI compiler wrappers:
sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc14
sudo port select --set mpi mpich-gcc14-fortran
hash -r

# Install optional tools:
sudo port -N install cdo +netcdf
```

:::{admonition} MPI library choice
:class: admonition-icontheme
You can try replacing `mpich` with `openmpi` in the commands above if the version of MPICH that is currently available via MacPorts fails the tests described in the [Software libraries](ref_buildrun_configuration_wrappersgeneric_sl) section. <a name="macos-openmpi-note"/>Please note that OpenMPI is known to encounter issues when running on macOS. Although the [list of known issues](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=osx) is very dated, some of them are still relevant. In particular, [this one](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=osx#startup-errors-with-open-mpi-2.0.x) (also see [here](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/7393)). The solution here is to run the configure wrapper with one more argument `BUILD_ENV="export TMPDIR='/tmp';"` and make sure that the `TMPDIR` environment variable is set to `/tmp` before running ICON.

### macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

**Tested on `macOS Sequoia 15.3`.**

Most of the required software packages are either already available on the system or installed together with the [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/), which are a [prerequisite for Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#macos-requirements). The rest of the required software can be installed by running the following commands:

```sh
# Install building tools and ICON dependencies:
brew install     \
  cmake          \
  eccodes        \
  gcc            \
  hdf5           \
  libfyaml       \
  libxml2        \
  mpich          \
  netcdf         \
  netcdf-fortran

# Install optional tools:
brew install cdo
```

:::{admonition} Notes
:class: admonition-icontheme
- You can try replacing `mpich` with `open-mpi` in the commands above if the version of MPICH that is currently available via Homebrew fails the tests described in the [Software libraries](ref_buildrun_configuration_wrappersgeneric_sl) section. See also the note above.
- The generic gcc configuration wrapper expects the GNU C and C++ compilers behind the MPI compiler wrappers. However, `mpicc` and `mpicxx` provided by Homebrew call the Apple Clang ones (i.e. `clang` and `clang++`, respectively) by default. Although the compiler flags specified in the configuration wrapper are compatible with Apple Clang, the latter might not have all required features (for example, it does not support OpenMP by default, see [here](https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/)). A way to override the C and C++ compilers called by the MPI compiler wrappers is to set the `MPICH_CC` and `MPICH_CXX` (or `OMPI_CC` and `OMPI_CXX` if you use `open-mpi`) environment variables before configuring and building ICON:
```sh
export MPICH_CC=gcc-14
export MPICH_CXX=g++-14
```
- By default, the `mpif90` MPI compiler wrapper provided by Homebrew calls the latest version of `gfortran`, which might not be compatible with ICON. In that case, you can switch to an older version. For example, to downgrade to GCC 12, you can run the foolowing commands:
```sh
# Install GCC 12:
brew install gcc@12

# Override the default compilers called by the MPI wrappers (MPICH):
export MPICH_FC=gfortran-12
export MPICH_CC=gcc-12
export MPICH_CXX=g++-12
```
- Replace `MPICH_` with `OMPI_` in the commands above if you use `open-mpi`.
