# ICON Namelists

All available Fortran namelist parameters are tabulated by name, type, default value, unit, description, and scope:

 - _Type_ refers to the type of the Fortran variable, in which the
value is stored: I=INTEGER, L=LOGICAL, R=REAL, C=character string
 - _Default_ is the preset value, if defined, that is assigned to
this parameter within the programs.
 - _Unit_ shows the unit of the control parameter, where applicable.
 - _Description_ explains in a few words the purpose of the parameter.
 - _Scope_ explains under which conditions the namelist parameter
has any effect, if its scope is restricted to specific settings of
other namelist parameters.

Information on the file, where the namelist is defined and used, is
given at the end of each table.



# Namelist parameters defining the atmospheric model

(ref_buildrun_nml_aes_phy_nml)=
## aes_phy_nml

The AES physics is configured by a data structure _aes_phy_config(jg=1:ndom)%\<param>_,
which is a 1-dimensional array extending over all domains. The structure contains
several parameters providing time control for the atmospheric forcing by the different
parameterizations. Further logical switches control how the atmospheric boundary conditions
for the AES physics are determined. Time control parameters are available for the atmospheric
processes tabulated below.


```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - _prc_
  - _parameterized process_

* - rad
  - LW and SW radiation

* - vdf
  - vertical diffusion

* - mig
  - graupel microphysics

* - two
  - two moment microphysics

* - car
  - Cariolle's linearized ozone chemistry

* - art
  - ART chemistry
```



The time control for an atmospheric forcing by a process _prc_ consists of
three components, the time interval _dt_prc_ for re-computing the forcing,
and the start and end dates and times defining the interval _[sd_prc,ed_prc[_,
in which the forcing is either computed, if the date/time coincides with the interval
_dt_prc_, or recycled. Recycling means that the forcing stored from the last
computation is used again. Outside of the interval the forcing is set to zero.

If _dt_prc_ is not specified, or an empty string or a string of blanks or an
interval of length 0s, e.g. _"PT0S"_ is given, then the forcing is switched
off for the entire experiment and the start and end dates and times are irrelevant.

If _sd_prc_ or _ed_prc_ are not specified, or an empty string or a
string of blanks are given, then the experiment start date and the experiment
stop date are used, respectively.

Further the forcing control switch _fc_prc_ can be used to decide if an
active process (_dt_prc_ > 0) is used for the integration
(_fc_prc_ = 1) or only computed for diagnostic purposes (_fc_prc_ = 0).

### Notes on the GRIB library backward compatiblity adjustment:


The I/O library CDI uses the ecCodes library for GRIB file handling.
Sometimes, version updates of ecCodes come along with a change in behavior
that results in some GRIB metadata having different values in GRIB output files (which cannot be avoided without additional measures).
This is undesirable, at least in operational NWP.
In order to allow for maintaining continuity, we try to "overwrite" such new behavior with an explicit reproduction of the prior behavior, if possible.
The following Table describes the options of the associated namelist parameter `grib_lib_compat`
in more detail.


```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - (Notes on the GRIB library backward compatiblity adjustment:-grib_lib_compat)=
    **grib_lib_compat**
  - **Description**
  - **Applies to GRIB lib version**
  - **Notes**

* - "current"
  - No adjustment applied.
  -
  -

* - "eccodes:2.31.0"
  - CDI uses the ecCodes sample GRIB file "GRIB2.tmpl" as a starting file for ecCodes. The `SecondFixedSurface` GRIB keys are assigned the following values in GRIB2.tmpl:
    * `typeOfSecondFixedSurface` = 255 (MISSING)
    * `scaleFactorOfSecondFixedSurface` = 255 (MISSING)
    * `scaledValueOfSecondFixedSurface` = 2,147,483,647 (MISSING)
    Now, if `typeOfSecondFixedSurface` is set to a value >= 10, 102 say ("Specific altitude above mean sea level"), but `scaleFactorOfSecondFixedSurface` and `scaledValueOfSecondFixedSurface` are not explicitly set, the result is as follows:
    **(1) For ecCodes version < 2.32.0**
    * `typeOfSecondFixedSurface`
    = 102
    * `scaleFactorOfSecondFixedSurface` = 0
    * `scaledValueOfSecondFixedSurface` = 0
    **(2) For ecCodes version >= 2.32.0**
    * `typeOfSecondFixedSurface` = 102
    * `scaleFactorOfSecondFixedSurface` = MISSING
    * `scaledValueOfSecondFixedSurface` = MISSING
    With `grib_lib_compat` = "eccodes:2.31.0", we try to reproduce behavior (1) even for ecCodes version >= 2.32.0.
  - ecCodes version >= 2.32.0
  - If the used ecCodes version is
    < 2.32.0, "eccodes:2.31.0" will be overwritten with "current".

    * .FALSE.: Workroot PE reads and decodes the records of a GRIB input file sequentially.
    * .TRUE.: Workroot PE reads the records and distributes them to all Work PEs for decoding in parallel.
    The second case requires input files of format GRIB2 with file extension '.grb', '.grb2', '.grib' or '.grib2'. In addition, a dictionary is mandatory (ana_varnames_map_file).  
    The data values packed in a GRIB file may have a bit depth up to bitsPerValue = 32. Note, however, that the data values are internally buffered in single precision (for reasons of efficiency) irrespective of the encoding accuracy, which may not deliver the maximum possible precision.  
    (A few corresponding timers are implemented and subordinated to the init_icon timer. Activating them requires timers_level > 8.)

### Restart read/write mode:


Allowed settings for `restart_write_mode` are:

`sync`

 - 'Old' synchronous mode. PE <br># 0 reads and writes restart files. All other PEs have to wait.

`async`

 - Asynchronous restart writing:
   Dedicated PEs (`num_restart_proc > 0`) write restart files
   while the simulation continues.  Restart PEs can only parallelize
   over different patches. --- Read-in: PE # 0 reads while other PEs
   have to wait.

`joint procs multifile`

 - All worker PEs write restart files to a dedicated
   directory. Therefore, the directory itself is called the restart
   file.  The information is stored in a way that it can be read back
   into the model independent from the processor count and the domain
   decomposition. --- Read-in: All worker PEs read the data in parallel.

`dedicated procs multifile`

 - In this case, all the restart data is first transferred to memory
   buffers in dedicated restart writer PEs.  After that, the work
   processes carry on with their work immediately, while the restart
   writers perform the actual restart writing asynchronously.  Restart
   PEs can parallelize over patches and horizontal indices.
   --- Read-in: All worker PEs read the data in parallel..


`""`

 - Fallback mode. <br> If num_restart_proc ` == 0`,
   then this behaves like `sync`, otherwise like `async`.



### Some notes on the output of optional diagnostics


{math}`\blacksquare` _How can I switch on the output of one of the available diagnostics?_

Let us assume that you would like to output _potential vorticity_
(see table of available diagnostics below) on model levels.
Simply add the following element to the desired output namelist (see [output_nml](ref_buildrun_nml_output_nml) ) in your run script:

```
&output_nml
...
ml_varlist = ..., 'pv'
...
/
```

Please note that the output of some diagnostics is restricted to the NWP mode
([iforcing](run_nml-iforcing) = inwp = 3, see column "Scope" in the table below).

{math}`\blacksquare` _Where can I find more about the computation of the diagnostics in the source code?_

_As for the ICON model component of the non-hydrostatic atmosphere:_

Each optional diagnostic has its own switch in the source code of ICON
which is set to `.TRUE.` if the diagnostic is found in one of the [output_nml](ref_buildrun_nml_output_nml) in your run script.
This configuration can be found in the module: <br>
{{ '[src/configure_model/mo_io_config.f90]({}/src/configure_model/mo_io_config.f90)'.format(base_url) }}.

Further information on the metadata of the diagnostics can be found
in their allocation area.
For the diagnostics that are meant for the NWP mode of ICON
([iforcing](run_nml-iforcing) = inwp = 3, see column "Scope" in table above),
the allocation takes place in:<br>
{{ '[src/atm_phy_nwp/mo_nwp_phy_state.f90]({}/src/atm_phy_nwp/mo_nwp_phy_state.f90)'.format(base_url) }}.<br>
Optional diagnostics with unrestricted scope are allocated in:<br>
{{ '[src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_nonhydro_state.f90]({}/src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_nonhydro_state.f90)'.format(base_url) }}.

The job control of the computation and output of most of the optional diagnostics
is organized by the post-processing scheduler:<br>
{{ '[src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_pp_scheduler.f90]({}/src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_pp_scheduler.f90)'.format(base_url) }}, <br>
{{ '[src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_pp_tasks.f90]({}/src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_pp_tasks.f90)'.format(base_url) }}, <br>
and integrated into the main time loop in:<br>
{{ '[src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_nh_stepping.f90]({}/src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_nh_stepping.f90)'.format(base_url) }}.<br>
The job control of a small portion of the diagnostics
is organized in: <br>
{{ '[src/atm_phy_nwp/mo_nwp_diagnosis.f90]({}/src/atm_phy_nwp/mo_nwp_diagnosis.f90)'.format(base_url) }}.

Finally, the computation of the individual diagnostics can be found
in the following modules
(the assignment of the keys, {[1]}, {[2]}, etc., to the respective diagnostic
is found in the column "Place of computation in source code" of table above):

The switches for the physics schemes and the time steps can be set for each model domain individually.
If only one value is specified, it is copied to all child domains, implying that the same set
of parameterizations and time steps is used in all domains. If the number of values given
in the namelist is larger than 1 but less than the number of model domains, then the settings
from the highest domain ID are used for the remaining model domains.

If the time steps are not an integer multiple of the advective time step (dtime), then the time step of the
respective physics parameterization is automatically rounded to the next higher integer multiple
of the advective time step. If the radiation time step is not an integer multiple of the cloud-cover
time step it is automatically rounded to the next higher integer multiple of the cloud cover time step.

### Notes on use of stochastic convection schemes

There are currently three stochastic convection schemes available, two versions for shallow convection and one for deep convection. Conceptually, these schemes attempt to represent that for grid box sizes smaller than the size of a typical cloud ensemble, the clouds actually populating the grid box will not be fully representative of that cloud ensemble.
The two stochastic shallow schemes (lstoch_expl, lstoch_sde) are therefore aimed at resolutions of a few kilometers (typically used for LAM simulations, where deep convection is resolved) and will in fact be automatically switched off for resolutions greater than 20km. The scheme converges to the standard Tiedtke-Bechtold mass flux scheme at resolutions sufficiently coarse, such that there is no additional gain from using the stochastic schemes. They should therefore be run with lshalloconv_only=T. A combination with the grayzone tuning (lgrayzone_deepconv) is technically possible, but not recommended as the grayzone tuning interferes with the intended behaviour of the stochastic scheme.

The stochastic deep convection scheme (lstoch_deep) is intended for resolutions where the deep convection parameterization is still active, but again, grid size is not large enough to contain a fully representative cloud ensemble (e.g. global runs with resolution on the order of 10s of kilometers). Thus the deep and shallow stochastic schemes are not intended to be used together, as the resolutions they are designed for are (mostly) mutually exclusive.

The shallow schemes should be run without resolution-dependent tuning of the convection parameters (lrestune_off=T) and with disabled mass flux limiters (lmflimiter_off=T). The mass flux limiters are in fact not fully disabled but set to values high enough to be rarely reached during shallow cloud simulations.
The deep stochastic scheme cannot be run without mass flux limiters or simulatons will become unstable.

## twomom_mcrph_nml

This namelist offers the possibility to adapt some configuration parameters of the two-moment cloud microphysical parameterisation by A. Seifert and K.D. Beheng. It is only effective if this scheme is used, i.e., if **inwp_gscp=4, 5, 6, or 7**.

The below set of parameters is a first reasonable choice to start with something. There might be coming more parameters in the future.

**Please note:** at the moment we do not support the option to have different configuration parameters on different domains.
We did not really test this up to now, but it cannot be ruled out for the future.
There are for sure parameters which could be optimized for different resolutions. Therefore, at the moment this possibility is not provided explicitly to the user via the below namelist parameters (they are scalars), but it is prepared internally in the ICON code.

Relevant if [output](run_nml-output)='nml'

Please note: There may be several instances of
[output_nml](ref_buildrun_nml_output_nml) in the namelist file, every one defining a list of variables with
separate attributes for output.

  -
  - Array of domains for which this name-list is used. If not specified (or specified as -1 as the first array member), this name-list will be used for all domains. *Attention:* Depending on the setting of the parameter l_output_phys_patch these are either logical or physical domain numbers!
  -

* - (output_nml-file_interval)=
    **file_interval**
  - C
  - " "
  -
  - Defines the length of a file in terms of an ISO-8601 duration string. An example for this time stamp format is given below. This namelist parameter can be set instead of [steps_per_file](output_nml-steps_per_file).

    **filename_format**
  - C
  - see description.
  -
  - Output filename format. Includes keywords `path`, `output_filename`, `physdom`, etc. (see below). Default is `<output_filename>_DOM<physdom>_<levtype>_ <jfile>`
  -

* - (output_nml-filename_extn)=
    **filename_extn**
  - C
  - "default"
  -

  - I
  - 4
  -
  - One of CDI's FILETYPE_XXX constants, or FILETYPE_NONE to prevent writing a file but adding the diagnostics (e.g. pressure level remap) to the variable list. Possible values:

    - 5: FILETYPE_NC4
    - 999: FILETYPE_NONE
  -

* - (output_nml-filter_spec)=
    **filter_spec**
  - C
  - None
  -
  - Compression algorithm for all NetCDF-4 output fields. The required filter is defined via a unique identifier and parameters for controlling the action of the compression filter [(list of registered filters)](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5_plugins/blob/master/docs/RegisteredFilterPlugins.md#list-of-filters-registered-with-the-hdf-group).  
  Here are two examples:  
  zstd with compression level 6: filter_spec='32015,6'  
  blosc with lz4 filter, compression level 5 and bitshuffle: filter_spec='32001,0,0,0,0,5,2,1'  
  Filters are available via HDF5 plugins. To be able to use them, the environment variable HDF5\_PLUGIN\_PATH must refer to a directory with an installation of these filters. Only filters installed in this directory are available. [More information about HDF5 filters](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/NUG/md_filters.html).

### Interpolation onto regular grids


Horizontal interpolation onto regular grids is possible through the namelist setting  [remap](output_nml-remap)=1, where
the mesh is defined by the parameters

 - [reg_lon_def](output_nml-reg_lon_def): mesh latitudes in degrees,
 - [reg_lat_def](output_nml-reg_lat_def): mesh longitudes in degrees,
 - [north_pole](output_nml-north_pole): definition of north pole for rotated lon-lat grids.


The regular grid points in [reg_lon_def](output_nml-reg_lon_def), [reg_lat_def](output_nml-reg_lat_def) are each specified by three values, given in degrees:
_start_, _increment_, _end_.
The mesh then contains all grid points {math}`start + k * increment <= end`, where {math}`k` is an integer.
Instead of defining an increment it is also possible to prescribe the number of grid points.

 - Setting the namelist parameter [reg_def_mode](output_nml-reg_def_mode)=0:
   Switch automatically from increment specification to no. of grid points,
   when the  `reg_lon/lat_def(2)` value is larger than 5.0.
 - 1: `reg_lon/lat_def(2)` specifies increment
 - 2: `reg_lon/lat_def(2)` specifies no. of grid points

For longitude values the last grid point is omitted if the end point matches the start point, e.g. for 0 and 360 degrees.


**Examples**

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Description
  - Parameter

* - local grid with 0.5 degree increment:
  - [reg_lon_def](output_nml-reg_lon_def) = -30.,0.5,30.

* -
  - [reg_lat_def](output_nml-reg_lat_def) = 90.,-0.5, -90.

* - global grid with 720x361 grid points:
  - [reg_lon_def](output_nml-reg_lon_def) = 0.,720,360.

* -
  - [reg_lat_def](output_nml-reg_lat_def) = -90.,360,90.
```



### Time stamp format


The namelist parameters `output_start`, `output_end`, `output_interval` allow
the specification of time stamps according to ISO 8601.
The general format for time stamps is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`
where `Y`: year, `M`: month, `D`: day for dates,
and   `hh`: hour, `mm`: minute, `ss`: second for time strings.
The general format for durations is `PnYnMnDTnHnMnS`.
See, for example, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601> for details and further specifications.

**NOTE:** as the mtime library underlaying the output driver
currently has some restrictions concerning the specification of durations:

1. Any number `n` in `PnYnMnDTnHnMnS` must have two digits. For instance use `"PT06H"` instead of `"PT6H"`
2. In a duration string `PnyearYnmonMndayDTnhrHnminMnsecS` the numbers `nxyz` must not pass the carry over number to the next larger time unit: 0<=nmon<=12, 0<=nhr<=23, 0<=nmin<=59, 0<=nsec<=59.999. For instance use `"P01D"` instead of `"PT24H"`, or `"PT01M"` instead of `"PT60S"`.


Soon the formatting problem will be resolved and the valid number ranges will be enlarged.
(2013-12-16).

**Examples**

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Description
  - Parameter

* - date and time representation (`output_start`, `output_end`)
  - **2013-10-27T13:41:00Z**

* - duration (`output_interval`)
  - **P00DT06H00M00S**
```



### Variable Groups

#### Keyword `tiles`

The `"tiles:"` keyword allows to add all tiles of a specific variable to the output, without the need to specify all
tile fields separately. E.g. `tiles:t_g` (read: "tiles of `t_g`") automatically adds all `t_g_t_X`
fields to the output. Here, `X` is a placeholder for the tile number. Make sure to specify the name of the aggregated
variable rather than the name of the corresponding tile container (i.e. in the given example it must be `t_g`, and not
`t_g_t`!).

_Note:_

There exists a special syntax which allows to remove variables from the output list, e.g. if
these undesired variables were contained in a previously selected group.<br>
Typing `-<varname>` (for example `-temp`) removes the
variable from the union set of group variables and other selected variables.
Note that typos are not detected but that the corresponding variable is
simply not removed!

Choosing more I/O processors than the total number of simulated radar stations of all domains is not advisable, because one station is handled by one I/O processor. However, less I/O processors can be chosen, in which case one processor handles several stations. I/O tasks actually include much more than plain output for each station and can be very time consuming. More details can be found in the EMVORADO User's Guide, available from the COSMO web page (<https://www.cosmo-model.org> {math}`\rightarrow` Documentation {math}`\rightarrow` EMVORADO) or from the emvorado submodule `externals/emvorado/DOC/TEX/emvorado_userguide.pdf`. If `num_io_procs_radar`=0, a subset of the worker processors (=number of radar stations) are doing the I/O tasks, which may slow down the model considerably.

## synradar_nml

The list of diagnostic output variables in ICON incorporates some fields related to synthetic radar reflectivity on the model grid:

 - `'dbz', 'dbz_850', 'dbz_cmax', 'dbz_ctmax'`
 - `'echotop', 'echotopinm'`

By default, these are based on a simple analytic so-called Rayleigh-approximation for single-particle backscattering.

If ICON is configured with the flag `--enable-emvorado` and compiled with the pre-processor flag `-DHAVE_RADARFWO`, some alternative, more accurate Mie- or T-matrix methods from the radar forward operator EMVORADO can be used by namelist choice (see below), particularly for improving the simulation of the so-called "bright band", the enhanced reflectivity in the melting layer.


EMVORADO is the Efficient Modular VOlume RADar Operator for simulating radar volume scans for cloud- and weather radar wavelengths, see

  -
  - This type contains: synradar_meta%itype_refl and many other parameters which are only relevant if itype_refl is not the default (4). Instance of the derived type   **dbzcalc_params** from EMVORADO to specify details of the radar reflectivity calculation for related outputs ('dbz', 'dbz_850', 'dbz_cmax', 'dbz_ctmax', 'echotop',   'echotopinm'). The type is documented in detail in the EMVORADO User's Guide.
    The most important component is **itype_refl:**
    **1:** Mie-scattering from EMVORADO assuming spherical particles and including a detailed melting scheme for the radar "bright band".
    **3:** Rayleigh-Oguchi approximation from EMVORADO including a simple melting scheme, but not producing pronounced "bright bands".
    **4:** Traditional Rayleigh approximation from ICON, also without pronounced "bright bands". **This is the default.**
    **5:** T-matrix scattering from EMVORADO assuming oblate spheroids, otherwise similar to Mie-option 1.
    **6:** T-matrix scattering from EMVORADO assuming spherical particles, only for sanity-checks against Mie-option 1.
    For options 1, 5, 6 there are many more relevant type components.

if upper-atmosphere physics are switched on.

Upper-atmosphere fields cannot be output in the GRIB format
([filetype](output_nml-filetype) = 2).

Upper-atmosphere fields entered on [output_nml](ref_buildrun_nml_output_nml): m/h/pl_varlist
need the prefix "upatmo_".

The following fields can be output, if {math}`\ldots`

{math}`\ldots` lupatmo_phy = .TRUE.:

# Serialization

(ref_buildrun_nml_ser_nml)=
## ser_nml

Some developments must not change model results. Serialbox allows reading and writing data at any point in ICON into savepoints. These savepoints can be used to restore model variables to some reference or compare different model versions. The simplest application of Serialbox is using {{ '[src/serialization/mo_ser_debug.f90]({}/src/serialization/mo_ser_debug.f90)'.format(base_url) }} (or writing a similar routine fitting ones needs). Following this method will allow reading and writing manually specified fields in ICON. This can be very useful for small subroutines where input and output are clearly specified (i.e. do not involve derived types) and can thus easily be translated to Serialbox read/write statements. For larger components (basically everything hanging from {{ '[src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_nh_stepping.f90]({}/src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_nh_stepping.f90)'.format(base_url) }}, e.g. nwp_physics) the interface is specified by the in and out types. The actual fields that are read or written to in these subroutines are not specified. For this purpose, serialize_all has been implemented. It provides a wrapper for Serialbox read and write statements by looping through variable lists. This approach does not require managing lists of fields to read or write by Serialbox. At the level of {{ '[src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_nh_stepping.f90]({}/src/atm_dyn_iconam/mo_nh_stepping.f90)'.format(base_url) }} and {{ '[src/atm_phy_nwp.mo_nh_interface_nwp.f90]({}/src/atm_phy_nwp.mo_nh_interface_nwp.f90)'.format(base_url) }} many components are wrapped by such serialize_all calls that allow testing these components. Each of these hard-coded calls to serialize_all has a name and for each name there is a namelist switch specifying the following triplet (e.g. 0,12,12):

 - If 0 do not use this savepoint, else use this savepoint at every time step
 - the relative threshold for errors (given as {math}`N` for {math}`N` in {math}`10^{-N}`)
 - the absolute threshold for errors (given as {math}`N` for {math}`N` in {math}`10^{-N}`)

This namelist is only usable (and needed) if the [Community Interface (ComIn)](ref_tools_comin) has been enabled during ICON's configure process.
Several `plugin_list(pg)` definitions can be specified, each holding the following namelist settings. The numbering (pg) of the plugins has to be contiguous without any gaps.

(ref_buildrun_nml_vlev_distr)=
# Information on vertical level distribution

The atmospheric model needs hybrid vertical level information (i.e. the so called vertical coordinate tables `vct_a`,
`vct_b` specifying the distribution of coordinate surfaces) to generate the terrain following height based coordinates. The 1D fields `vct_a`, `vct_b` are created within ICON
during the setup phase, given that no input file is provided (empty vct_filename).
For the SLEVE vertical coordinate (`ivctype=2`), the creation  of `vct_a`, `vct_b` is controlled by the
Namelist [sleve_nml](ref_buildrun_nml_sleve_nml) together with the parameter num_lev.
For the Gal-Chen vertical coordinate (`ivctype=1`), the user has only very limited control regarding its ICON internal creation.
It is e.g. possible to create an equidistant level distribution for idealized testcases, by specifying the parameters `layer_thickness`
and n_flat_level. For more general grids, it is recommended to read the vertical coordinate tables from file.
Example files and information on the required format can be found in `<icon home>/vertical_coord_tables`, as well as in the ICON tutorial.
Note that for the SLEVE coordinate, only `vct_a` must be provided in the input file. It is recommended to set `vct_b` to zero.



# Compile flag for mixed precision

To speed up code parts strongly limited by memory bandwidth (primarily the dynamical core and the tracer advection),
an option exists to use single precision for variables that are presumed to be insensitive to computational accuracy.
This affects most local arrays in the dynamical core routines (solve_nonhydro and velocity_advection), some local
arrays in the tracer transport routines, the metrics coefficients,
arrays used for storing tendencies or differenced fields (gradients, divergence etc.), reference atmosphere fields,
and interpolation coefficients. Prognostic variables and intermediate variables affecting the accuracy of mass conservation
are still treated in double precision. To activate the mixed-precision option, run the configure script with the
`--enable-mixed-precision` flag.




# Appendix A: Arithmetic expression evaluation

The {{ '[externals/fortran-support/src/mo_expression.F90]({}/externals/fortran-support/src/mo_expression.F90)'.format(base_url) }} module evaluates basic arithmetic
expressions specified by character-strings.

It is possible to include mathematical functions, operators, and
constants.
An application of this module is the evaluation of arithmetic
expressions povided as namelist parameters.

Besides, Fortran variables can be linked to the expression and used in
the evaluation.
The implementation supports scalar input variables as well as 2D and
3D fields.

From a users' point of view, the basic usage of this module is
described in subection below.
Technically, infix expressions are processed based on a Finite State
Machine (FSM) and Dijkstra's shunting yard algorithm.
A more detailed described of the Fortran interface is given in
Section [usage with fortran](ref_buildrun_nml_fortran).


(ref_buildrun_nml_arithmetic)=
## Examples for arithmetic expressions


Basic examples:

 - `sqrt(2.0)`
 - `sin(45*pi/180.) * 10 + 5`
 - `if(1. > 2, 99, -1.*pi)`
 - `min(1,2)`


Variables are used with a bracket notation:

 - `sqrt([u]^2 + [v]^2)`

Note that the use of variables requires that these are enabled
("linked") by the Fortran routine that calls the
{{ '[externals/fortran-support/src/mo_expression.F90]({}/externals/fortran-support/src/mo_expression.F90)'.format(base_url) }} module.

* - `a ^ b`
  - {math}`a^b`

* - `a > b`
  - `1` if `a > b`, `0` otherwise

* - `a < b`
  - `1` if `a < b`, `0` otherwise
```





### List of available constants


```{list-table}

  - {math}`4 \, \mathrm{atan}(1)`
  - mathematical constant equal to a circle's circumference divided by its diameter

* - `r`
  - {math}`6.371229\cdot 10^6`
  - Earth's radius. This number seems to be based on Hayford's 1910 estimate of the Earth. It is used in ICON as well as MPAS and was almost certainly taken from the Jablonowski and Williamson test case (QJRMS, 2006).
```



(ref_buildrun_nml_fortran)=
## Usage with Fortran


The minimal Fortran interface is as follows:

1. The `TYPE expression` which is initialized with the
   character-string that specifies the arithmetic expression.
2. The type-bound procedure `evaluate()`, which returns the
   result (scalar or array-shaped) as a `POINTER`.
3. The type-bound procedure `link()` connecting a variable
   to a name in the character-string expression.



### Fortran examples


The following examples illustrate the arithmetic expression parser.
The calls to `DEALLOCATE` the data structures have been
ommitted for the sake of brevity:

1. Scalar arithmetic expression:

```
formula = expression("sin(45*pi/180.) * 10 + 5")
CALL formula%evaluate(val)
  ... use "val" for some purpose ...
```

2. Masking of a 2D array as an example for the `link` procedure:

```
formula = expression("if([z_sfc] > 2., [z_sfc], 0. )")
CALL formula%link("z_sfc", z_sfc)
CALL formula%evaluate(val_2D)
  ... use "val_2D(:,:)" for some purpose ...
```



### Error handling


Invalid arithmetic expressions yield "empty" expression objects. When these
are evaluated, a `NULL()` pointer is returned.

A successful expression evaluation can be tested with the `err_no` variable:

```
IF (formula%err_no == ERR_NONE) THEN
  ...
END IF
```

In case of error, the `err_no` variable also provides the
reason for the aborted evaluation process.



## Remarks


 - Variable names are treated case-sensitive!
 - For 3D array input it is implicitly assumed that 2D fields are
   embedded in 3D fields as "3D(:,level,:) = 2D(:,:)".



# Appendix B: Changes incompatible with former versions of the model code

This page documents namelist changes that are incompatible with earlier
versions of the model code. Incompatible changes include renaming
namelist parameters or changing their type, removing parameters,
changing default settings, changing parameter scope, or introducing
new cross-check rules.
