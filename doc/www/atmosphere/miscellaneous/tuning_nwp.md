# Tuning parameters

_Please note that this description applies to the [](ref_atmosphere_nwp_physics)_.

To get the best performance out of a model for a specific application, or for a particular area on the globe, it can be useful to change certain parameters of the model specification within reasonable bounds.

**ICON model parameters suitable for model tuning**

The tables summarize the most important tuning variables for the ICON model, and are largely based on {term}`Reinert et al. 2025`, chapter 12.2 and {term}`Avgoustoglou et al. 2020`. Yet, the document and the list of variables should be handled with care. Purely varying some of the listed parameters blindly will most likely not give satisfactory results. A physical understanding of the identified model shortcomings/biases should be built up first, followed by a choice of the associated model parameters and a systematic variation and evaluation of simulations. The parameters of interest may strongly vary for the region of interest, the model resolution and the specific purpose.
Please also keep in mind that the list is neither exhaustive, nor complete. There may well be further model parameters that are more suitable for individual applications.
