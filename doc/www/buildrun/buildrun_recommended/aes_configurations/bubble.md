## Description

The basic set-up of the bubble experiment consists of an atmosphere over a [bi-periodic domain](https://easy.gems.dkrz.de/Processing/playing_with_triangles/toroidal_grids.html). A roughly 20 km deep atmosphere is discretized over 70 layers and initialized to form two uniformally stratified layers upon which a perturbation is imposed. The first layer extending upwards with a temperature profile given by

```{math}
T(z) = T_0 + z\Gamma_0
```

to a height z_0 above which the temperature follows the profile

```{math}
T(z) = T(z_0) + (z-z_0)\Gamma_1
```

where T_0, z_0, Gamma_0, and Gamma_1 are parameters that can be specified. The humidity is set to a constant prescribed value. The perturbation, or "bubble", is specified as a latitudinally slab symmetric gaussian perturbation in relative humidity and temperature that is centered at the surface and the central longitude. The surface is given the properties of saturated water at a fixed temperature, and the mean wind is initialized to 0 m/s.
In terms of the physical set up, it is often most useful to vary T_0 (`aes_bubble_config%t0` which is set in `aes_bubble_nml`) and the surface temperature (`ape_sst_val` which is set in `nh_testcase_nml`) as this determines the phase of the condensate that forms in the bubble.
